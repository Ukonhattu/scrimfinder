User stories ScrimFinder

As a user, I can register to the website easily and without too much hassle
As an admin, I want to ensure that no bots are able to use the platform.
As a user I can submit posts looking for scrims with time, map/maps, team name/server on/off and other information (mr30)
As a user I am also able to only look for certain level of scrims divided by ESEA/CEVO leagues (open, intermediate, main, advanced etc) for example both while searching for other people’s scrims and while posting my own
As an admin I am able to receive users’ applications for higher levels of scrim finding and manage their permissions. 
As a user I am able to apply for higher levels of scrim finding by submitting a photo from the internal team page to verify that I am in the team of this level
As a user I am able to report players for improper behavior and/or not being on the level required
As a user I am able to modify the info on the scrim-finding posts and the post will show a sign that it is edited. I can also post comments on the post, for example to inform the other party that my team is unable to play the scrim. If such comment is posted on an already agreed-to scrim, then the page will make a sound to inform the other party and display a notification. 
As a user I am able to respond to other people’s posts by simply pressing “Ask to scrim”. The other party will see the collection of teams asking to scrim with team name, level and player name. Then they can pick the team they want to scrim against.
When I post my scrim, the page will auto-fill some info from my settings, but I can modify this info (server ip, team name)
I can edit my settings
I can also send private messages to other players on the platform
As an admin I can delete user profiles and edit their information and settings
